<!-- ROADMAP -->
# 'Securities Exchange Tradebook'
I must've implemented this at least 15 times when recruiting at HFT firms; I wanted to see how optimally I could implement it, and what it would look in in a language other than CPP. What's interesting is that this approach is from the perspective of the exchange. That is, the goal is to match and log orders in the way an exchange would (as opposed to actively seeking and executing arb opportunities)

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic Python Implementation
  - [X] Add testing suite
  - [X] Add proper toString and readability
  - [X] Added ability to read from JSON
- [ ] C++ Implementation
  - [ ] Heap Implementation
  - [ ] Memory Optimization
  - [ ] JSON Support
